## Objective of this project : 
**Given an input, the algorithm provides the apartments/houses that best match the customer's choice.**

## How was it built?
* The first step was data collection;<br/> 
(Property data were collected through a crawler from the www.quintoandar.com.br)<br/> 
The web scrapping code is in this notebook : <br/>
[Scrapping quintoandar.com.br](code/scrapping_quintoAndar.ipynb)<br/><br/>

* The second step was process data;<br/>
(The processing of the data was carried out so that a dataset could be obtained in an easy-to-analyse format, as the data coming from the crawler was in .json format)<br/>
The process data code is in this notebook : <br/>
[Processing data from quintoandar.com.br](code/process_data.ipynb)<br/><br/>

* The third step was analyzing data;<br/>
(The analysis aims to suggest properties for rent according to the user's preference, given their preference, properties are suggested in downtown SÃ£o Paulo that meet these criteria, through data from the fifth floor website and data from the api of the website of the foursquare)<br/>
The data analysis code is in this notebook: <br/>
[Data analysis from quintoandar.com.br and Foursquare API](code/analyzing_data.ipynb)<br/><br/>
